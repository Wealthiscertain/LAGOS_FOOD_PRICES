# LAGOS FOOD PRICES
Of the 36 states in Nigeria today, Lagos is considered to be one of the most expensive states to live in. This is because Lagos is the commercial hub of Nigeria, attracting numerous top-notch organizations. Hence, this has led to massive development in the state and subsequently a higher cost of living.



Food is any nutritious substance that people eat or drink to maintain life and growth. Food is essential to our everyday life, The high cost of living in Lagos has led to an increase in the prices of food. 
We will be analyzing the Selected food prices data (December 2021) gotten from the National Bureau of Statistics (https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/1241108) to understand the changes in prices of rice on a month-on-month basis and year-on-year. 
This data includes selected food prices from January 2017 to December 2021.
Our focus on this research will be rice because rice is easily the most sought after food in Lagos and Nigeria in general.



The dataset contains the prices of 43 selected food items across the 36 states in Nigeria. We will be extracting the data for Lagos alone since our analysis is based on the changes in rice prices in Lagos.
